**Speaking rate and intelligibility in children’s speech**

Poster for our presentation at the 2022 Motor Speech conference in San Diego,
CA.

## Abstract
Prior work has documented how children’s intelligibility and articulation rate increased over the childhood years. We
asked whether speaking rate influenced intelligibility in a sample of 538 typically developing children between ages 2;6
and 9;11 (years;months). Because utterance length can influence intelligibility (more words providing additional
sentence context) and rate (more words requiring more efficient speech in a single fluent utterance), we stratified rate
and intelligibility scores by utterance length. We found a small negative effect of speaking rate on intelligibility at
younger ages for longer utterance lengths. For example, at age 4;0, an increase in rate of .5 syllables per second
predicted a corresponding decrease in intelligibility of 3-5 percentage points on 5-7-word utterances. For shorter items
or for children older than age 5, this rate effect is negligible. Implications will be discussed.
